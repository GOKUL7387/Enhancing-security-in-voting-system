# In this project, we aim to develop an advanced voter authentication and tracking system that leverages biometric technology for secure and efficient electoral processes. The system integrates a fingerprint scanner with a robust database to store and manage voter details, ensuring data integrity and security. When a voter places their finger on the scanner, the system matches the fingerprint against the database to verify identity.
Upon successful authentication, the voterâ€™s status is updated to "voted." The system also includes safeguards to prevent duplicate voting attempts, triggering a warning if a fingerprint is scanned more than once. Additionally, a web-based interface is provided for real-time monitoring and management of voter data, displaying information such as the number of male and female voters, those who have voted, and those yet to vote. This solution minimizes human intervention, enhances security against voter fraud, and provides a transparent and user-friendly mechanism for election management. The project is built using modern technologies, including biometric SDKs, web technologies, and a PostgreSQL database, to create a scalable and reliable system.
